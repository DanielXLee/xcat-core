=head1 NAME

B<mknb> - creates a network boot root image for node discovery and flashing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<mknb> I<arch>


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<mknb> command is run by xCAT automatically, when xCAT is installed on the management node.
It creates a network boot root image (used for node discovery, BMC programming, and flashing)
for the same architecture that the management node is.  So you normally do not need to run the B<mknb>
command yourself.   

If you do run B<mknb> to add custom utilities to your boot root image, and you have an xCAT Hierarchical Cluster with service nodes that each have a local /tftpboot directory (site sharedtftp=0), you will also need to copy the generated root image to each service node.


Presently, only the arch x86_64 is supported.
